# Domain_Dominance
 Domain Dominance is a trading card game (TCG) created by Taylor Cook. This is the PC version. 
 The game will be developed in stages, from Text-Based -> 2D Graphics -> Networked
 
 Currently (for testing purposes) the game can be played from Game.py. 
 This is expected to change to startGame.py once a menu is officially added.
